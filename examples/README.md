# Java Client API Examples

This project contains example code for using and testing Java client APIs for phone
number classifiers.

Each classifier is made up of:
1. A metadata configuration file.
2. The metadata file generated from that config.
3. A loader to provide the metadata at runtime.
4. A class exposing the functionality via a client API.

In the example project, there are two classifiers with distinct APIs, and four
versions of the metadata:

## ExampleClassifier

An example classifier with the following features:


## LibPhoneNumberClassifier
